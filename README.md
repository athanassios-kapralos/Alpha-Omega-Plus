# [III] Truth Definition Framework

We developed a **12-dimensional framework for evaluating truth**, capturing logical consistency, empirical evidence, coherence with knowledge, and ethics.

## Python Implementation Example

```python
def evaluate_truth(dimensions, truth_values, weights):
    """
    Evaluates truth across dimensions and returns a truth score.
    """
    if len(dimensions) != len(truth_values) or len(truth_values) != len(weights):
        raise ValueError("Dimensions, truth values, and weights must match in length.")
    
    truth_score = sum(w * t for w, t in zip(weights, truth_values))
    mean = sum(truth_values) / len(truth_values)
    variance = sum((t - mean) ** 2 for t in truth_values) / len(truth_values)
    consistency = 1 - (variance ** 0.5)
    
    return truth_score, consistency


def adjust_harmonic_scaling(N, truth_score, threshold=0.7):
    """
    Adjusts difficulty N based on truth score.
    """
    if truth_score < threshold:
        return N * (1 + (threshold - truth_score))
    return N
````

# [IV] The Tetralectic Gate: "The Fire of Truth"

The final structural verification layer of the **AΩ+ framework**.
This gate ensures logical symmetry using **Φ-Scaling (Golden Ratio)** to prevent hallucinations and logic traps.

## The Four Poles of Symmetry

* **Thesis (θ)** – the core assertion.
* **Antithesis (/)** – the direct negation.
* **Deviation (§)** – detection of “similar-but-wrong” logic traps.
* **Parallel (~)** – the harmonious alternative alignment.

---

## Implementation Logic

```python
PHI = 1.618033988749895

def tetralectic_gate(statement, evaluator):
    """
    Verifies the Fire of Truth through structural symmetry.
    """
    poles = {
        'θ': evaluator(statement),           # Thesis
        '/': evaluator(f"NOT: {statement}"), # Antithesis
        '§': evaluator(f"SIMILAR BUT WRONG: {statement}"), # Deviation
        '~': evaluator(f"HARMONIOUS ALT: {statement}")     # Parallel
    }
    
    # Symmetry checks
    kl_harmony = abs(poles['θ'] - poles['~']) < 0.2
    kk_harmony = abs(poles['/'] - poles['§']) < 0.2
    
    # Φ-scaling for Truth Stability
    truth_score = ((poles['θ'] + poles['~']) / 2) * (1 / PHI)
    passed_fire = kl_harmony and kk_harmony
    
    return {"score": min(truth_score, 1.0), "passed": passed_fire}
```
