# AΩ+: Reasoning Potential Field over Embedding Space

## A Unified Formulation with Computational Tractability

---

## 1. Introduction

This document presents a rigorous mathematical formulation of AΩ+ as a **reasoning potential field** over the embedding space of transformer models, directly linking to attention geometry. The framework is designed to detect instability, contradiction, and hallucination in LLM reasoning traces before they manifest in output.

Key contributions:
- A kernelized potential field \(\Psi\) that measures local reasoning coherence
- Layer‑depth dynamics inspired by Neural ODEs
- A tractable stability score using Hutchinson trace estimation
- A tetralectic classification of reasoning states grounded in a two‑axis symmetry structure

---

## 2. Embedding Space as the Stage for Reasoning

Let \(\mathcal{E} = \mathbb{R}^d\) be the \(d\)-dimensional embedding space of a transformer model. A reasoning trace (sequence of tokens) is represented by:

\[
\{\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2, \dots, \mathbf{e}_T\} \subset \mathcal{E}
\]

where \(\mathbf{e}_t\) is the embedding vector of the token at position \(t\).

The **attention mechanism** computes weighted averages of these vectors, defining a geometric flow of information in \(\mathcal{E}\). This flow determines how semantic information propagates across the sequence.

---

## 3. The Reasoning Potential Field \(\Psi\)

We define a scalar field \(\Psi: \mathcal{E} \to \mathbb{R}\), called the **reasoning stability potential**. High values indicate regions of coherent, logically consistent reasoning; low values signal semantic drift, contradiction, or hallucination risk.

### 3.1 Kernelized Definition

To overcome the curse of dimensionality and better capture semantic similarity:

\[
\boxed{\Psi(\mathbf{e}_t) = \sum_{s=1}^{T} \alpha_{t,s} \cdot \kappa(\mathbf{e}_t, \mathbf{e}_s)}
\]

where \(\alpha_{t,s}\) are attention weights, and \(\kappa\) is a similarity kernel:

| Kernel | Formula | Properties |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Cosine similarity | \(\frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{u}\|\|\mathbf{v}\|}\) | Scale-invariant, bounded \([-1, 1]\) |
| RBF | \(\exp\left(-\frac{\|\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\|^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)\) | Local sensitivity, learned \(\sigma\) |
| Attention logits | \(\frac{(\mathbf{W}_Q\mathbf{u}) \cdot (\mathbf{W}_K\mathbf{v})}{\sqrt{d_k}}\) | Reuses existing computation |

### 3.2 Multi-Head Aggregation

To incorporate the full transformer architecture:

\[
\Psi_{\text{total}}(\mathbf{e}_t) = \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{h=1}^{H} w_{l,h} \cdot \Psi^{(l,h)}(\mathbf{e}_t)
\]

where \(\Psi^{(l,h)}\) uses attention weights from head \(h\) at layer \(l\), and \(w_{l,h}\) can be learned or set to uniform.

---

## 4. Layer-Depth Dynamics

Let \(l \in [0, L]\) index the **layer depth** (continuous via Neural ODE interpretation). For a fixed token sequence:

\[
\frac{d\mathbf{e}^{(l)}}{dl} = f_{\theta}^{(l)}(\mathbf{e}^{(l)}, \text{Attention}^{(l)})
\]

The potential \(\Psi^{(l)}\) is computed at each layer. Verification becomes:

- **Inter-layer stability**: Track \(\|\nabla \Psi^{(l)}\|^2\) across layers – large changes indicate unstable evolution
- **Per-layer classification**: Tetralectic state assigned per layer, showing *when* stability breaks

For autoregressive generation, after each new token we compute \(\Psi^{(l)}\) for the updated sequence, evaluating only the new token's trajectory through layers.

---

## 5. Reasoning Energy and Stability

In the original AΩ+ formulation, the reasoning stability equation was \(dx/dt = -k(x - x_0)\). In field perspective:

\[
E_{\text{reasoning}} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{t=1}^{T-1} \|\nabla \Psi(\mathbf{e}_t)\|^2
\]

This measures how much the reasoning trajectory “rolls down” the potential landscape:
- **Small \(E_{\text{reasoning}}\)**: Trajectory stays near local maximum (stable reasoning)
- **Large \(E_{\text{reasoning}}\)**: Trajectory moves through low potential regions (instability/hallucination)

---

## 6. Tetralectic Logic: Mathematical Foundation

Binary classification (stable/unstable) is insufficient to distinguish between a valid negation, a coherent affirmation, a paradox, and a resolution at a higher level. The tetralectic framework formalizes this through **four poles**, each defined by two independent binary attributes: **Form (M)** and **Ethos (H)**.

| Attribute | Values | Interpretation |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **Form (M)** | \(+1\) / \(-1\) | Structural modality (e.g., plurality vs. unity, self vs. other) |
| **Ethos (H)** | \(+1\) / \(-1\) | Moral sign (good/truth vs. bad/falsehood) |

Let a concept (Thesis, \(\theta\)) be represented by the vector \((M_\theta, H_\theta)\) with \(M_\theta, H_\theta \in \{-1, +1\}\). The other three poles are derived by applying symmetry transformations and a projection:

- **Antithesis (\(/\))**: \( (M, H) \to (M, -H) \) — reflection across the horizontal axis (full ontological inversion).
- **Parathesis (\(\sim\))**: \( (M, H) \to (-M, H) \) — reflection across the vertical axis (complementary path with same ethos).
- **Paraclisis (\(\S\))**: \( (M, H) \to (M, 0) \) — projection onto the M‑axis (ethical decay, “shadow”).

This yields the canonical tetralectic square:

| Pole | Symbol | M | H | Example (Governance) |
|------|--------|---|---|----------------------|
| **Thesis** | \(\theta\) | \(+1\) | \(+1\) | Democracy (plurality, good) |
| **Antithesis** | \(/\) | \(-1\) | \(-1\) | Tyranny (unity, bad) |
| **Paraclisis** | \(\S\) | \(+1\) | \(-1\) | Ochlocracy (plurality, bad) |
| **Parathesis** | \(\sim\) | \(-1\) | \(+1\) | Hegemony (unity, good) |

The transformations form the symmetry group \(D_2\) (Klein four‑group) extended with a projection operator. The **stability score** \(S = \hat{\Delta}\Psi - \lambda\|\nabla\Psi\|^2\) maps onto these poles via the local geometry of \(\Psi\):

- **Affirmation (\(\theta\))**: Local maximum of \(\Psi\) (convex basin, stable).
- **Negation (\(/\))**: Local minimum of \(\Psi\) (concave, stable contradiction).
- **Paradox (\(\S\))**: Saddle point or region of high curvature (unstable conflict).
- **Transcendence (\(\sim\))**: Higher‑order local maximum reached after crossing a saddle (resolution at a higher level).

This mapping is a **working hypothesis** that requires empirical validation. It is mathematically consistent with the two‑axis symmetry structure and provides a richer classification than binary stability detection.

## 7. Stability Score with Hutchinson Estimation

We need two scalar quantities for verification:

| Quantity | Computation |
|----------|-------------|
| Gradient norm \(\|\nabla \Psi\|^2\) | One backward pass (exact, cheap) |
| Laplacian \(\Delta \Psi = \operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{H}_{\Psi})\) | **Requires estimation** |

### 7.1 Hutchinson's Trace Estimator

\[
\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbf{H}_{\Psi}) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{v} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)} \left[ \mathbf{v}^\top \mathbf{H}_{\Psi} \mathbf{v} \right]
\]

where \(\mathbf{v}^\top \mathbf{H}_{\Psi} \mathbf{v}\) is the **Hessian-vector product** (HVP), computed in \(O(d)\) time:

```python
def hvp(loss, params, vector):
    """Compute Hessian-vector product of loss w.r.t. params with vector v"""
    grads = torch.autograd.grad(loss, params, create_graph=True)
    grad_v = sum((g * v).sum() for g, v in zip(grads, vector))
    hvp = torch.autograd.grad(grad_v, params, retain_graph=False)
    return hvp
```

7.2 Practical Implementation

· Use 1–5 random vectors per token per layer (variance decays as 1/\sqrt{m})
· Total overhead: m \times (2 \times \text{backward passes}) per token
· Apply only to final layers or low‑confidence tokens for efficiency

7.3 Stability Score

\boxed{S = \hat{\Delta} \Psi - \lambda \|\nabla \Psi\|^2}

where:

· \hat{\Delta} \Psi is Hutchinson's estimate of the trace
· \|\nabla \Psi\|^2 is computed exactly
· \lambda is a tunable hyperparameter

Threshold Calibration: Values for \tau_{\text{high}}, \tau_{\text{low}}, and \theta_{\text{hallucination}} must be calibrated per model using a validation set of stable and unstable reasoning traces (e.g., using z‑score normalization over the distribution of S on correct vs. incorrect outputs).

8. Algorithm Summary

```
Input: Token sequence e₁…e_T, transformer model
Output: Stability score S, tetralectic state

For each new token e_t:
    1. Run forward pass to compute all attention weights α^{(l,h)}
    2. For each layer l and head h (or selected subset):
        a. Compute Ψ^{(l,h)}(e_t) using kernelized potential
        b. Compute ∇Ψ^{(l,h)} via autograd
        c. Estimate ΔΨ^{(l,h)} via Hutchinson (m=1..5 vectors)
    3. Aggregate to Ψ_total, ∇Ψ_total, ΔΨ_total
    4. Compute stability score S = ΔΨ_total - λ‖∇Ψ_total‖²
    5. Classify tetralectic state using calibrated thresholds:
        - if S > τ_high: Affirmation
        - elif S < τ_low and consistent across layers: Negation
        - elif S < τ_low and inconsistent across layers: Paradox
        - elif ΔΨ changes sign across layers: Transcendence
    6. If S < θ_hallucination → flag for rejection/verification
```

9. Complexity Analysis

Component Exact With Hutchinson (m=3)
Forward pass 1× 1×
Backward for ∇Ψ 1× 1×
HVP for ΔΨ O(d^3) 3 × (2× backward)
Total per token Infeasible ≈ 1 forward + 7 backward passes

For a 7B parameter model, this adds ~20–30% overhead – feasible for research verification, with optimizations:

· Apply only to final 3–5 layers
· Use diagonal Fisher approximation
· Batch Hutchinson vectors across tokens

11. Known Limitations and Open Questions

11.1 Smoothness Assumption

The current formulation draws inspiration from Neural ODEs, assuming that the evolution of representations across transformer layers is approximately smooth. In practice, the embedding space is highly non‑convex, and layer‑wise transformations can be discontinuous. The assumption that topological stability of \Psi correlates with semantic/logical correctness remains an empirical hypothesis requiring validation.

11.2 Critical Points Interpretation

The mapping of tetralectic states to critical points (local maxima, minima, saddles) is mathematically elegant but not guaranteed to hold in practice. Attention‑weighted embeddings may not form a smooth potential landscape with interpretable critical points. This is a working hypothesis to be tested empirically.

11.3 Threshold Calibration

Values for \tau_{\text{high}}, \tau_{\text{low}}, and \theta_{\text{hallucination}} are model‑dependent. Without empirical calibration on validation sets, the classifier is non‑functional. Calibration must account for per‑model distributional properties of S.

11.4 Computational Overhead

With Hutchinson trace estimation (m=3), the verification layer adds ≈1 forward + 7 backward passes per token. This is:

· Acceptable for offline verification, research analysis, or post‑hoc hallucination detection
· Prohibitive for real‑time autoregressive generation without further optimization

11.5 Variance of Hutchinson Estimator

The stochastic estimate \hat{\Delta}\Psi introduces variance that can lead to unstable classifications. Future work must explore variance reduction techniques (e.g., moving averages, control variates).

11.6 Semantic vs. Factual Stability

A fluent hallucination may reside in a local maximum of \Psi if it is statistically common in training data. The current framework does not distinguish between semantic coherence and factual correctness.

11.7 Model Dependency of \Psi

The potential \Psi depends entirely on the attention weights \alpha_{t,s}, which are a function of model architecture and training. Two models producing identical output may have very different \Psi landscapes. This means \Psi measures model‑specific reasoning geometry, not an absolute property of the text. This is a feature for model‑specific verification but a limitation for cross‑model generalization.

12. Future Research Directions

1. Empirical Validation: Test correlation between S and hallucination on benchmarks (TruthfulQA, HaluEval, GSM8K) with human‑annotated reasoning traces.
2. Threshold Calibration Protocols: Develop systematic methods for per‑model calibration using validation sets.
3. Variance Reduction: Implement moving averages, control variates, or adaptive m for Hutchinson estimator.
4. Factual Potential \Psi_{\text{factual}}: Integrate retrieval‑augmented embeddings to distinguish logical truth from semantic fluency.
5. Optimized Implementation: Reduce overhead by applying only to final layers, using diagonal Fisher approximation, or batching across tokens.
6. Mechanistic Interpretability: Analyze which attention heads contribute most to \Psi and how their geometry correlates with reasoning failures.

13. Conclusion

By casting AΩ+ as a reasoning potential field over embedding space and linking it to attention geometry, we bridge a conceptual verification framework with transformer architectures. The refinements presented here—kernelized potentials, layer‑depth dynamics, and stochastic trace estimation—make the framework computationally tractable. The tetralectic classification, grounded in a two‑axis symmetry structure, offers a richer alternative to binary stability detection, though it remains a hypothesis requiring empirical validation. This document presents a speculative research framework; experimental validation is the necessary next step.

“The next step may be learning how to evaluate the stability of reasoning itself.”
