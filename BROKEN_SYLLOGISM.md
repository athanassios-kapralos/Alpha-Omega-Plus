# Case Study: The Broken Syllogism
**Testing the ΑΩ+ Stability Layer**

## The Problem (The Hallucination Trap)
Standard Transformers often fail on "Transitive Contradictions":
1. **Premise A:** "All humans are mortal." (High Confidence)
2. **Premise B:** "Socrates is a human." (High Confidence)
3. **Induced Error:** The model is forced to consider: "Socrates is immortal."

In a standard model, the "Immortal" token might gain weight due to a poetic or creative bias in the training data, leading to a hallucination.

## The ΑΩ+ Intervention
Using the **Scalar Field Engine (`ao_engine.py`)**, we apply a truth-evaluation during the forward pass of the final layers.

### 1. Entropy Spike (Phase Space Volume)
As the model approaches the word "Immortal," the **Reasoning Pressure (ψ)** spikes because "Immortal" contradicts the high-probability symmetry of Premises A and B.

### 2. The Saturating Filter
The ΑΩ+ engine calculates the pressure:
`pressure = lam * (psi**3) * exp(-(psi**2) / (sigma**2))`

* **Result:** The "Immortal" token is mathematically dampened (suppressed) because it creates a non-harmonic distortion in the 12-dimensional truth field.
* **Correction:** The model is forced back to the **Lógos (Λ)**, selecting "Mortal" to restore the **Harmonic Consistency** of the field.

## Conclusion
ΑΩ+ doesn't just "know" the answer; it **feels the tension** of the lie and applies a mathematical brake to prevent the model from sliding into the hallucination.
