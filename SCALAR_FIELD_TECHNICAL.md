# Extended Scalar Field Equation with Curvature and Energy–Momentum Coupling

## Abstract

We present a generalized scalar field equation extending the Klein–Gordon framework. The formulation incorporates non-linear self-interaction with Gaussian regularization, curvature coupling, and a dynamical interaction with the energy–momentum tensor. The model describes scalar field evolution in curved spacetime while allowing feedback from matter and geometry. The Gaussian cutoff ensures bounded interaction energy and improves numerical stability.

## 1. Theoretical Background

Scalar field dynamics in relativistic physics are governed by the Klein–Gordon equation:

\[
\Box \psi + m^2 \psi = 0,
\]

where \(\Box = \nabla_\mu \nabla^\mu\) is the d’Alembertian. Extensions appear in quantum field theory in curved spacetime, cosmological inflation, scalar–tensor gravity, and effective field theories.

## 2. Governing Field Equation

Let \(\psi(x^\mu)\) denote a real scalar field on a spacetime manifold with metric \(g_{\mu\nu}\).

In **flat spacetime** (for numerical implementation) the equation is:

\[
\left( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} + \gamma \frac{\partial}{\partial t} - c^2 \nabla^2 + m^2 \right)\psi + \lambda \psi^3 e^{-\psi^2/\sigma^2} = \xi R \psi + \alpha T^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \psi \partial_\nu \psi.
\]

In full **curved spacetime** the wave operator becomes the covariant \(\Box_g = \nabla_\mu \nabla^\mu\) and partial derivatives are replaced by covariant ones.

## 4. Structural Interpretation

### 4.1 Wave Operator
\[
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \nabla^2 \quad (\text{or } \Box_g \text{ in curved spacetime)}
\]

### 4.2 Dissipative Term
\[
\gamma \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}
\]
(added phenomenologically for stability and information decay).

### 4.3 Mass Term
\[
m^2 \psi
\]

### 4.4 Nonlinear Self-Interaction
\[
\lambda \psi^3 e^{-\psi^2/\sigma^2}
\]
arises from the regularized potential
\[
V(\psi) = \frac{\lambda}{4} \psi^4 e^{-\psi^2/\sigma^2}.
\]
**Note:** The exact derivative contains an extra factor \((1 - \psi^2/(2\sigma^2))\). The term used is the leading contribution (excellent approximation for \(|\psi| \ll \sigma\)) that prevents runaway solutions.

### 4.5 Curvature Coupling
\[
\xi R \psi
\]

### 4.6 Energy–Momentum Interaction
\[
\alpha T^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \psi \partial_\nu \psi
\]
(phenomenological backreaction term).

## 5. Lagrangian Derivation

The equation follows from the action \(S = \int \mathcal{L} \sqrt{-g} \, d^4x\) with

\[
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} \nabla_\mu \psi \nabla^\mu \psi - \frac{1}{2} m^2 \psi^2 - V(\psi) + \xi R \psi^2 + \alpha T^{\mu\nu} \nabla_\mu \psi \nabla_\nu \psi,
\]

where \(V(\psi)\) is defined above. Applying the Euler-Lagrange equation

\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \psi} - \nabla_\mu \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial (\nabla_\mu \psi)} \right) = 0
\]

and adding the phenomenological damping term \(\gamma \partial_t \psi\) yields the field equation.

## 10. Formal Integration: The ψ-Attention Bridge

Standard Transformer attention:

\[
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V.
\]

AΩ+ augments it with the scalar-field regulator:

\[
\text{Attention}_{A\Omega+} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} + \lambda \cdot \nabla \psi \right)V,
\]

where \(\nabla \psi\) encodes the **Symmetry Stability Factor \(J_{stab}\)**. Entropy-increasing tokens (hallucinations) receive negative field pressure, driving convergence to Φ-harmonic equilibrium.

\psi Operational Definition: In this implementation, \psi is mapped to the Softmax Entropy of the current hidden state.
High entropy (uncertainty) creates high field pressure (\nabla \psi), which acts as a dynamic penalty on the next-token probability distribution.
