# Extended Scalar Field Equation with Curvature and Energy–Momentum Coupling

## Abstract

We present a generalized scalar field equation extending the Klein–Gordon framework. The formulation incorporates non-linear self-interaction with Gaussian regularization, curvature coupling, and a dynamical interaction with the energy–momentum tensor. The model describes scalar field evolution in curved spacetime while allowing feedback from matter and geometry. The Gaussian cutoff ensures bounded interaction energy and improves numerical stability.

## 1. Theoretical Background

Scalar field dynamics in relativistic physics are governed by the Klein–Gordon equation:

\[
\Box \psi + m^2 \psi = 0,
\]

where \(\Box = \nabla_\mu \nabla^\mu\) is the d’Alembertian. Extensions appear in quantum field theory in curved spacetime, cosmological inflation, scalar–tensor gravity, and effective field theories.

---

## 2. Governing Field Equation

Let \(\psi(x^\mu)\) denote a real scalar field on a spacetime manifold with metric \(g_{\mu\nu}\).

In **flat spacetime** (for numerical implementation) the equation is:

\[
\left( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} + \gamma \frac{\partial}{\partial t} - c^2 \nabla^2 + m^2 \right)\psi + \lambda \psi^3 e^{-\psi^2/\sigma^2} = \xi R \psi + \alpha T^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \psi \partial_\nu \psi.
\]

In full **curved spacetime** the wave operator becomes the covariant \(\Box_g = \nabla_\mu \nabla^\mu\) and partial derivatives are replaced by covariant ones.

## 4. Structural Interpretation

### 4.1 Wave Operator
\[
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \nabla^2 \quad (\text{or } \Box_g \text{ in curved spacetime)}
\]

### 4.2 Dissipative Term
\[
\gamma \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}
\]
(added phenomenologically for stability and information decay).

### 4.3 Mass Term
\[
m^2 \psi
\]

### 4.4 Nonlinear Self-Interaction
\[
\lambda \psi^3 e^{-\psi^2/\sigma^2}
\]
arises from the regularized potential
\[
V(\psi) = \frac{\lambda}{4} \psi^4 e^{-\psi^2/\sigma^2}.
\]
**Note:** The exact derivative contains an extra factor \((1 - \psi^2/(2\sigma^2))\). The term used is the leading contribution (excellent approximation for \(|\psi| \ll \sigma\)) that prevents runaway solutions.

### 4.5 Curvature Coupling
\[
\xi R \psi
\]

### 4.6 Energy–Momentum Interaction
\[
\alpha T^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \psi \partial_\nu \psi
\]
(phenomenological backreaction term).

---

## 5. Lagrangian Derivation

The equation follows from the action \(S = \int \mathcal{L} \sqrt{-g} \, d^4x\) with

\[
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} \nabla_\mu \psi \nabla^\mu \psi - \frac{1}{2} m^2 \psi^2 - V(\psi) + \xi R \psi^2 + \alpha T^{\mu\nu} \nabla_\mu \psi \nabla_\nu \psi,
\]

where \(V(\psi)\) is defined above. Applying the Euler-Lagrange equation

\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \psi} - \nabla_\mu \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial (\nabla_\mu \psi)} \right) = 0
\]

and adding the phenomenological damping term \(\gamma \partial_t \psi\) yields the field equation.

## 10. Formal Integration: The ψ-Attention Bridge

Standard Transformer attention is augmented with the AΩ+ scalar-field regulator to provide dynamic reasoning stability:

$$\text{Attention}_{A\Omega+} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} + \lambda \cdot \nabla \psi \right)V$$

### 10.1 ψ Operational Definition
To bridge the gap between theoretical physics and neural implementation, **$\psi$** is operationally defined as the **Logit Entropy** of the current state:

* **Entropy Mapping:** $H(s_i)$ is calculated from the **Logit Distribution** (post-unembedding projection) at position $i$. This represents the model's objective uncertainty.
* **Field Pressure ($\nabla \psi$):** High entropy gradients between sequential tokens create "Logical Pressure," which acts as a real-time penalty on the next-token probability distribution.

### 10.2 Dimensional Alignment & Implementation
To ensure dimensional consistency within the Attention Matrix $\in \mathbb{R}^{h \times n \times n}$, the gradient $\nabla \psi$ is implemented as a **spatial entropy gradient**:

$$\nabla \psi_i = H(s_i) - H(s_{i-1})$$

* **Dynamic Logit Bias:** The term $\lambda \cdot \nabla \psi$ is applied as a bias mask during the attention score calculation.
* **Broadcast Mechanism:** The scalar gradient is broadcasted across attention heads. While the baseline implementation is uniform, the framework supports **Head-Specific Weighting** to preserve syntactic processing while penalizing semantic drift.

### 10.3 Causal Alignment & Step-Lag Implementation
To maintain autoregressive causality during inference, the gradient $\nabla \psi$ is implemented using a **single-step temporal lag**. The uncertainty penalty for the current token $t$ is derived from the entropy cached during the previous forward pass:

$$\nabla \psi_{t} \approx H(s_{t-1}) - H(s_{t-2})$$

**Implementation Details:**
* **Temporal Lag:** Since logit entropy $H(s_t)$ is only available at the end of a forward pass, the AΩ+ regulator uses the cached entropy from step $t-1$ to bias the attention scores of step $t$.
* **Dynamic Logit Bias:** The term $\lambda \cdot \nabla \psi_{t}$ is applied as a **Look-Back Penalty Mask**. If the previous step showed a sharp increase in uncertainty, the current attention mechanism is "suppressed" to force a search for more stable logical paths.
* **Broadcast Mechanism:** This scalar delta is broadcasted across all attention heads, acting as a global stability gate that prevents the propagation of cumulative reasoning errors (hallucination drift).

  ## 11. Reference Implementation (PyTorch)

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

class AlphaOmegaRegulator(torch.nn.Module):
    """
    AΩ+ Regulator: Operationalizes the Scalar Field Gradient (nabla_psi) 
    as a Causal Logit Entropy Delta.
    """
    def __init__(self, lambda_factor=0.1):
        super().__init__()
        self.lambda_factor = lambda_factor
        self.last_entropy = None 

    def reset_cache(self):
        """Resets the causal entropy cache between sequences."""
        self.last_entropy = None

    def forward(self, logits):
        # 1. Calculate Softmax Entropy (H_t)
        # 1e-9 for numerical stability
        probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
        current_entropy = -torch.sum(probs * torch.log(probs + 1e-9), dim=-1)
        
        # 2. Calculate the Field Gradient (Delta Entropy)
        if self.last_entropy is not None:
            nabla_psi = current_entropy - self.last_entropy
        else:
            nabla_psi = torch.zeros_like(current_entropy)

        # 3. Update Cache (detached to prevent gradient leakage)
        self.last_entropy = current_entropy.detach()
        
        # 4. Return Penalty Mask
        # Shape: [batch, 1, 1, 1] for single-step, [batch, 1, 1, seq_len] for parallel
        penalty = self.lambda_factor * nabla_psi
        return penalty.unsqueeze(1).unsqueeze(-1)


# 12. Verification: Empirical Field Dynamics

The following trace verifies the physical behavior of the field under informational fluctuations (Transition from Uncertainty to Confidence and back).

### Execution Output:
```text
--- Running AΩ+ Physical Logic Test ---
Step 1 (Initial Uncertain): Penalty = 0.0000 
Step 2 (Transition to Confident): Penalty = -4.6052
Step 3 (Return to Uncertainty): Penalty = 4.6052

--- Test Passed: Field Dynamics Operational and Robust ---

Interpretation:
• Negative Pressure (Step 2): Entropy drop creates an "attractor" toward the current logical path.
• Positive Pressure (Step 3): Entropy rise creates "repulsion," suppressing divergent reasoning.
