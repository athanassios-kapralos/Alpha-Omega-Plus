The AΩ+ framework uses two complementary ψ variables.

ψₜ (Truth Psi)
semantic coherence across twelve dimensions.

ψₑ (Entropy Psi)
information entropy of the token distribution.

The regulator operates on ψₑ while the theoretical model
describes ψₜ. Future work explores their mapping.

ψ (Psi) — Scalar Truth Field for Multidimensional Reasoning

1. Purpose

The ψ field is the central scalar quantity of the AΩ+ framework.
It represents the global coherence of a statement across multiple semantic dimensions of truth.

Within the theoretical model:

ψ = scalar field describing reasoning stability

Instead of treating truth as a binary variable, AΩ+ treats it as a multidimensional stability state emerging from the interaction of several logical dimensions.

A statement is considered stable when it maintains consistency across these dimensions.
Instability corresponds to contradiction, hallucination, or semantic collapse.

2. Conceptual Model

In AΩ+ reasoning space:

Reasoning Space = R¹²

Each axis corresponds to a dimension of truth evaluation.

A statement becomes a point in this space:

S = (D₁, D₂, ..., D₁₂)

Where each dimension evaluates a different aspect of semantic validity.

The ψ field represents the coherence of this multidimensional vector.

3. The Twelve Dimensions of Truth

The following twelve dimensions form the basis vectors of the AΩ+ truth manifold.

Dimension	Symbol	Meaning
Nominal	D₁	correctness of naming or reference
Conceptual	D₂	correctness of definition or concept
Propositional	D₃	logical implications derived from the statement
Applicative	D₄	scope of validity (to whom/what it applies)
Spatial	D₅	location or domain where the statement holds
Modal	D₆	mode of truth (necessity, possibility, contingency)
Temporal	D₇	time validity
Quantitative	D₈	magnitude or measurable degree
Qualitative	D₉	nature or intrinsic quality
Causal	D₁₀	correctness of causal explanation
Intuitive	D₁₁	experiential plausibility
Logical	D₁₂	formal logical consistency

Each dimension returns a score:

Dᵢ ∈ [-1 , 1]

Where:

1   = full affirmation
0   = neutral / undefined
-1  = contradiction


⸻

4. ψ as Multidimensional Truth Coherence

The ψ field measures how stable a statement is across all truth dimensions.

Basic Definition

ψ = mean(D₁ ... D₁₂)

or

ψ = (1/12) Σ Dᵢ

Range:

ψ ∈ [-1 , 1]

Interpretation:

ψ value	Meaning
~1	highly stable truth
~0	ambiguous / weak coherence
~−1	strong contradiction


⸻

5. Energy Interpretation (Field Stability)

To better reflect the field-theoretic interpretation of reasoning, ψ can be derived from an energy function.

Define instability energy:

E = Σ wᵢ (1 − Dᵢ²)

Where:

wᵢ = dimension weight

Then define the scalar field:

ψ = exp(-E)

Interpretation:

high coherence → low energy → ψ → 1
high contradiction → high energy → ψ → 0

This formulation aligns with the AΩ+ concept that truth corresponds to stable field configurations.

⸻

6. Geometric Interpretation

A statement occupies a position in the truth manifold:

S = (D₁, D₂, ..., D₁₂)

The ψ value represents distance from instability.

Example:

ψ = ||S||

or

ψ = stability(S)

This allows reasoning to be interpreted as movement within a semantic geometry.

⸻

7. Tetralectic Gate Interaction

AΩ+ introduces four logical modes for evaluating propositions:

Symbol	Mode
θ	affirmation
/	negation
§	contradiction
~	parallel coherence

Each dimension may be evaluated through these modes.

Example conceptual process:

evaluate thesis
evaluate antithesis
evaluate deviation
evaluate parallel relation

ψ measures the overall coherence across these tetralectic states.

⸻

8. Practical Approximation Using LLMs

The ψ field can be approximated by querying an LLM across the twelve dimensions.

Example prompts:

Nominal:
"Does the term correctly identify the concept?"

Conceptual:
"Is the definition conceptually accurate?"

Causal:
"Does the explanation correctly describe the cause?"

Logical:
"Is the reasoning logically consistent?"

Each evaluation produces a score.

These scores populate the dimension vector:

S = (D₁ ... D₁₂)


⸻

9. Reference Python Implementation

Example minimal ψ evaluator:

import numpy as np

def compute_psi(dimensions, weights=None):
    
    D = np.array(dimensions)

    if weights is None:
        weights = np.ones(len(D))

    energy = np.sum(weights * (1 - D**2))

    psi = np.exp(-energy)

    return psi

Example usage:

dimensions = [
0.9,  # nominal
0.8,  # conceptual
0.85, # propositional
0.7,  # applicative
0.9,  # spatial
0.8,  # modal
0.9,  # temporal
0.75, # quantitative
0.8,  # qualitative
0.85, # causal
0.7,  # intuitive
0.9   # logical
]

psi = compute_psi(dimensions)

print("ψ =", psi)


⸻

10. Interpretation of ψ Values

ψ Range	Interpretation
0.85 – 1.0	strong semantic stability
0.65 – 0.85	moderate coherence
0.40 – 0.65	weak or partial validity
0.20 – 0.40	unstable reasoning
0 – 0.20	contradiction or hallucination


⸻

11. Role of ψ in the AΩ+ Framework

Within the broader system:

ψ → scalar reasoning field

It serves as the core stability variable governing the system dynamics.

Conceptually:

stable reasoning = stable ψ field
hallucination = unstable ψ oscillation

Thus AΩ+ transforms truth evaluation into a problem of field stability within a multidimensional semantic manifold.

⸻

12. Summary

The ψ field provides a bridge between:

philosophical truth analysis
multidimensional semantic evaluation
field-based reasoning dynamics

By representing truth as a coherence state across twelve dimensions, AΩ+ defines reasoning as the search for stable configurations within a semantic field.

**Note:** The correspondence ψₑ ↔ ψₜ is a working hypothesis. 
High entropy correlates with instability, but low entropy does 
not guarantee truth coherence. Empirical validation is required.
